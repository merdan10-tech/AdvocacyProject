      Imagine a young soccer enthusiast living in a community where access to soccer facilities and training is limited.
      Or imagine a soccer-loving family with children of different ages, all sharing one pair of soccer shoes for their
      beloved sport. The importance of equal access to soccer opportunities is evident, yet disparities persist,
      especially for those with limited resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      The need for digital equity in soccer has become increasingly clear. The digital divide, much like disparities in
      soccer access, still affects many individuals, including aspiring young players and seniors who want to stay
      connected to the sport they love. While progress has been made, there are still communities where youth,
      low-income households, and seniors lack access to soccer training, resources, and facilities. Access to soccer
      should be a 21st-century right, just like access to the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      We invite you to join us by signing this petition in support of a Soccer Equity Bill of Rights. Together, we can
      work towards a more equitable soccer experience for all.
