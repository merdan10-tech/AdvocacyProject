<h1>Web Dev Advocacy Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I have been diligently crafting a website centered around the positive influence of social media within the realm of soccer. The core concept of this platform revolves around delivering users the latest news and updates within the soccer community. The website features a header with navigation links to various soccer-related sources, a language selector, and a captivating slogan. Additionally, it includes a separate 'Petition Form' page, where visitors can sign the Soccer Equity Bill of Rights petition. The project aims to promote equal access to soccer opportunities, bridging disparities and advocating for digital equity within the sport.

My journey with this project began approximately 7-8 weeks ago, and I am pleased with the current state of development. I am still actively working on the project, and when it's completed, it will be a fully functional website with impressive features. I've been working on this project as part of the Codepath program and have received high marks for my efforts.
