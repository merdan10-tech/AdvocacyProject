<h1>Web Dev Advocacy Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I have been diligently crafting a website centered around the positive influence of social media within the realm of soccer. The core concept of this platform revolves around delivering users the latest news and updates within the soccer community. My journey with this project commenced approximately 7-8 weeks ago, and I am pleased with the current state of development.

I am still currently working on this project, and by the time I finish, it will be a fully functional website with astonishing features. I have been working on this project for the Codepath program and have received high marks for it.
